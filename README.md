# Remote Roofing Frontend Challenge

## Design Principles
Since this is a small project, I decided to use functional components instead of class components. 

I saw from the page specifications that each page had the same header, but different page titles. Because of this, I thought it would be useful to create a `<Navbar>` component that took in a `pageTitle` prop.

**React Router** for component navigation.
